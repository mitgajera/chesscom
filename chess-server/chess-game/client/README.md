# Chess Game Client

This is the client-side application for the Chess Game project. It is built using React and TypeScript, and it communicates with the server using Socket.IO for real-time game updates.

## Getting Started

To get started with the client-side application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd chess-game/client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.
